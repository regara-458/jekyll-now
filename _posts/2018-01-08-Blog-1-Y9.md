Title: Google sheets

Objective: Get familiar with google sheets and set up our own one

So to start off we got on computers set ourselves our seats and proceeded to log into the google classroom. From there we came to the front of classroom and got shown how a shop could use google sheets to work out how much something cost if they are buying lots of different items with different price. Then we got back to our places started doing it by ourselves working out prices of items and then trying to get totals. Unfortunately after pricing everything and showing items we had to finish because the lesson was over.
