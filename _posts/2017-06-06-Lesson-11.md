  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by reading the information part of the text which is above the instructions part. I looked carefully at this and then used the facts in there to help with instructions so I knew what the words meant. My partner's next to me would also help if I had no clue</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My full work capacity was limited due to the fact if I got stuck on one I wouldn't be able to skip it and if I was ahead of partners they wouldn't know what to do because they weren't as far in or too far ahead.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will go back in previous works completed and use them for future reference Eg. If I can't remember what one word is or does I look back at previous instructions. My learning will be improved by full concentration on the code. </td>
