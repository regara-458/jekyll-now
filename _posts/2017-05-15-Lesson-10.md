    <td>Following instructions and reading things like checkpoints and analysing them to get to the correct outcome checking through previous lesson helped. Learning some language parts for example what it would be if a number said 3**6 I'd have much more sense of what was going on.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited when on website the tip wasn't available so you had to think completely on you own. I need to try things and try them more often because then there are more chances of success.</td>

    <td>Next time I will research or look up hints to find outcome or ask a friend in the class for he may know exactly what you don't. If i am out of resorts and no one around me knows I will ask the teacher for advice.</td>
