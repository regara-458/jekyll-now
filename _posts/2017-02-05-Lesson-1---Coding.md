    <td>I learnt how to set up the Fuze box with the dell computer. I also got to grips with the memory stick and how to save my work on the stick and have it safely saved. We learnt how to use an application that we write code and it makes the code work we get the code from a book/manual that teaches us everything. Effective strategies was taking turns in using the manual so we both get learning experience.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It being my first lesson because I was very unfamiliar with everything so that slowed me down also not knowing how to save for ten minutes cut back on some work time however now I'm experienced this shouldnâ€™t be a problem. I need to work on going through the manual faster and reading and understanding all its contents.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will load my saved work onto the computer get it on the application then continue to work with the manual swapping more often with my partner so we share the work experience. I will also change the way I go through the manual so it is more effective by reading quicker reading all of it so I understand more as well as copying down the diagrams of code so my machine and code works effectively. I will take all criticism and advice onboard.</td>
