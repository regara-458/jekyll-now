**Blog 2**

This lesson was mainly based on fixing our blogs to start with update code make sure there are no errors and if so fix them. I tried changing my background from colour to a still image. I wanted to test posting and getting the post to work and it did so I put the first blog of the new year on. In the lesson I learnt how to change background and see all my posts. As well as add totals to spreadsheet and use discounts if there are any.
