  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by trying new things such as making new codes with different file. I learnt by help from others as one because you learn things quicker and they make more sense. The booklet is very helpful as it's resourceful and says everything you need to know.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by the failure of our memory sticks as we struggled to save our work. They loaded the work but couldn't save it. I think we should try to find the error at the beginning so it saves us the hassle of doing it at the end. Also typing takes a while so swap goes with partner</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to make sure I know how to save and fix the problem. I will also make separate documents for each new bit of code. I will also try to see others if they're having this issue and maybe consult some for help. I'll improve my learning by trying to fix any problems early on</td>
