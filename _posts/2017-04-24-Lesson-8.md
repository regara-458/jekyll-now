    <td>I learnt by getting use to machines and some machines weren't as cooperative as the others for example some may have limited turning and some might not go up and down as much. For this it's all about getting accustomed to everything </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The learning was a also a hindrance for having faulty arms slows down the work time. We would often have to swap the arms for they didn't all be as able as the others to perform our needed tasks. We couldn't really fix this for it's all a matter of luck having faulty or not faulty</td>

    <td> Next time I shall look for a better looking and more prestige looking one so I can be more sure it shall not fail me. My learning shall also be improved by having everything set up before the robot arm make its show </td>
