  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by analysing all of the classes robotic arms to see how to set it up and required assistance occasionally. Strategies included memorising the tutorial which was what number did what so what made it go up down left right etc. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited due to speed and having to get the code on the computer. I now only need to get footage of the arm working and set it up so that I have proof of working arm. I also should work on trying to pick things up with the arm.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will challenge myself so that I can film me or partner picking up a pencil or rubber and then moving it somewhere else. My learning shall be improved by experimenting with the new work.</td>
